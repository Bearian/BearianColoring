test_sol: SOLUTION TEST for Graph Coloring, V2.2 - 
Last revision: February 2004

This brief program verifies solutions for the graph coloring problem in
the context of the DIMACS Computational Challenge.  Two input files are
required: the instance file in the ASCII DIMACS file format (see
http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/COLOR04/ for details), and the solution file.

The solution file has to be an ASCII file consisting in a single column
of numbers. Each number represents the color assigned to the node
numbered as the corresponding row number. Both colors and nodes are
supposed to start with 1. 

A directory called "examples" is included in the archive with an
example of instance, and two solutions: one feasible and another
infeasible.

In case a solution is not feasible the program returns the number of
constraint violations. This number is computed as number of conflicting
edges, that is, edges with ending nodes having the same
color. Furthermore it also returns the number of nodes involved in at
least one conflict.

COMPILATION

The code has been so far tested on Linux and MacOsX platform. For
compiling the source code in both environments a simple call to the
Makefile by the "make" command should suffice.


This version handles also problems of set-T-coloring. 
See test_sol --help for more details.
